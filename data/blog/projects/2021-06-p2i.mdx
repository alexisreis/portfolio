As a final project for a class on sensors, we chose, with 5 fellow students to
try and build an automatic car with Arduino cards and a variety of sensors. The
goal was to create a car that could drive itself around a track. The car was
controlled by an Arduino and used sensors to detect the track and obstacles.

Here is the car we built :

We also added a GPS sensor to the car to track its position and speed. The GPS
was connected to the car Arduino which communicated with another Arduino plugged
into a computer. This computer ran a Java program that displayed the car's
position on a map and store the data in a MySQL database.
