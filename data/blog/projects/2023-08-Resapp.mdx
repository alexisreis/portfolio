summary: 'Internship in Worldline Labs in Villeurbanne, France. I worked on a
webapp to handle reservations for shared machines.'
---

## Context
As part of a 3 months internship at Worldline Labs. Conception and
development of a booking
service on the Worldline Labs infrastructure.
The app was called **Resapp**.

## My mission
During this mission my goals were :
1. To test an emergent JS framework ([Remult](https://www.remult.dev)) and
report about it
2. Use it by developing a service allowing users to book shared machines.
