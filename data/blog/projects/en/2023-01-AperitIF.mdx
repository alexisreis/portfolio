As a school project, we had to create a search engine using semantic web and
DBpedia. With my 7 students group, we chose to create a search engine for
cocktail recipes.

We used the [DBpedia](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/) database to get the data we
needed to display :

* the **cocktails** (the name, the description, the ingredients, the recipe,
the
images)
* the **alcohols** (the name, the description, the image, the cocktails that
used them)

## Screenshots

* The searchbar: you can type any cocktail or alcohol name you want

* The results page : you can see the cocktails that match your search, with
its recipe, and similar cocktails
