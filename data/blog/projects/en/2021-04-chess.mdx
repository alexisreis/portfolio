summary: 'Chess board game development in Java'
---

As a final project, we had to develop a human-machine interface allowing two people to play a game of chess on computers.
In a team of 5 students, in second year of engineering school, we divided the work as follows:
- 2 people on the graphical interface (graphics for the board, the pieces, the
menus, etc.)
- 3 people on the game engine (the rules, the moves, the pieces, etc.)
We used the Java object-oriented language and the Swing library.
