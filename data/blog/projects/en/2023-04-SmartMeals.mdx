## The idea

As students, we always feel that we are running in circles when we cook. We
always eat the same meals, buy the same ingredients, and we never know what
to do with the leftovers if one ingredient is missing. We wanted to create an
app that would help us manage our grocery list and help us find recipies with it.

So we imagined a mobile app that could :
1. scan receipts to add ingredients to your inventory
2. manage your inventory
3. find recipies with your inventory
4. create a grocery list with the missing ingredients to make new recipies

All of this with a nice UI, a good UX and without storing any of our users
data on our side.

## The team

We were 7 people in the team, all from the same school.
As we had already worked 3 months together, we knew each other, and we knew
how to communicate and organize ourselves. We had :
* 2 designers (to design the UI and UX)
* 2 backend developers (to create the API and the service that scan
articles from receipts)
* 2 frontend developers (to create the mobile app and connect it to the API
and the smartphone camera)
* 1 project manager (to manage the team and the project)

I was officially a **frontend developer**, but I also **helped the backend
team** as they used Python and Flask which I was familiara with since my
[annotation-app project](/blog/projects/2022-08-annotation-app).


## The deadline

The main difficulty of this project was by far its deadline as we only had 2
weeks to conceptualize, design, develop and present our project in front of
a jury. We had to be efficient and to work fast. We
worked 5 days a week, 8 hours a day in a coworking room.

## The result

In the end, we managed to create a mobile app that could scan receipts,
manage your inventory and find recipies with your inventory. The demo that
we presented to the jury was a success.

If only we had more time, we could have added more features and improve the
app. But we were all happy with the result, and we were proud of what we
achieved in only 2 weeks.
