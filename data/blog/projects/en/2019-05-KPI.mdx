authorized person with disabilities'

As a high-school final engineering project, we were tasked to create a
prototype to solve a problem. We decided to create a prototype of an
intelligent door that would open for authorized person with disabilities.
Here is our final prototype :

We used Arduino, RFID sensors, a servo motor and a buzzer to create this.
